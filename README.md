# projectIdeas
Stop thinking about what to build 

Possibilities:
- a small RPG
- a pig latin translator
- a travel planner/journal (use the Bergen vacation to build a demo)
- a fantasy league auto-drafter
- a clone of that card game with the red and blue dragons!!
- hangman
- everything on the FCC take home project list, but not necessarily in JS
