# projectIdeas
Stop thinking about what to build 
Possibilities:
- a small RPG
- a pig latin translator
- a travel planner/journal (use the Bergen vacation to build a demo)
- a fantasy league auto-drafter
- a clone of that card game with the red and blue dragons!!
- hangman
- everything on the FCC take home project list, but not necessarily in JS
- a dinosaur fact catalog
- an original gen pokedex
- a scraper that gives you the top post on r/learnprogramming, r/cscareerquestions, r/programmingcirclejerk, dev.to, HN, and other places
- my super cool spotify idea that I need to read API docs for
- a 4-element dice game in Java (I super need to learn Java before school starts)
- a browser extension that converts "millenials" to "adults under 40"
- tax estimator
- a thing that takes a picture and draws it as an outline
- a thing that sends you/people a text message when there are weather events (it's raining, it's a snow day, etc)
- RELEVANT TO MY LIFE: a pre-move inventory of stuff
- ticketing system
